# Time Series Analysis

The aim of this project is to analyze a specific time series which has been assigned to our group 15, as well as to fit an ARIMA model following the Box-Jenkins Methodology. The [time series assigned](./data/data_g15.xlsx) presents subsidised housing approvals as a percentage of the total approvals. The dates in the dataset range from January 1990 to December 2007 and the source is [Banco de Espa√±a](www.bde.es).

## Implementation

Several R packages were used for the implementation, including _tseries_, _ggplot2_ and _forecast_. The [code](./time_series_analysis.R) was carefully documented explaining every output. The full report can be found at [docs](./docs/time_series_analysis_report.pdf)
